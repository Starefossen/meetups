# Pre-written messages for organizers to send to their members

Here's a collection of pre-written messages you can use as an organizer to communicate with your
members/attendees in a consistent and informative way.

## Agenda published

If you initially published without an agenda, you might wanna send an announcement when your
agenda is complete, like follows:

```txt
Hi everybody,

The agenda for our next meetup is now announced:

PASTE_FROM_MEETUPS_REPO

Hopefully you'll find this content interesting! If you have feedback on what we could do better,
please send an email to me at ORGANIZER_EMAIL. We're always looking for ways to improve!

More information about the meetup can be found here:

- MEETUP_LINK
- https://github.com/cloud-native-nordics/meetups/tree/master/CITY

{if livestream: } The event will be **livestreamed** at https://youtu.be/LINK, starting at TIME.

Do you have stories about how your organization is successful (or not!) with cloud native?
Then **apply to speak** at one of our future events at CFP_LINK!
We're always looking for speakers for upcoming meetups.

Thank you all, have a nice day!

On behalf of the organizing team,

## Update your RSVP

In order to make sure the RSVP count is as close to the real "show-up" number as possible,
and to make preparing food and drinks easier, it's worth it to send these two reminders to
the people that have RSVP'd **Yes** and are on the waitlist.

### A week before

Hi everyone,

Only few days to our next meetup at PLACE! Exciting!

The event is **fully booked**, and we have more than WAITLIST_SIZE persons on the waitlist (!), so to make sure we have a minimal amount of no-shows, PLEASE update your RSVP status ASAP.

If you cannot make to the event, please update your RSVP status to "No".
In the event page (link below), top right corner, click the big "X" button if you CANNOT
make it on DATE.

Thank you!

### On the day of the meetup

```txt
Subject: Let's meet today!
---
Hi everyone,

Today we're having our next meetup in PLACE at TIME!

Note that the event is **fully booked** and we have WAITLIST_SIZE persons on the waitlist (!),
so in order to allow as many as possible to attend, please update your RSVP status.

If you cannot make to the event, please update your RSVP status to "No".
In the event page (LINK), top right corner, click the big "X" button if you CANNOT
make it today.

We will have a swag sharing table, so feel free to bring and share your company's favourite swag.

{if livestream: } The event will be **livestreamed** at https://youtu.be/LINK, starting at TIME.

Thank you for your participation, see you later today!

## Statement on possible meetup.com pricing changes

All organizers of Cloud Native Nordics shall preferably send this kind of message to their
member to keep things clear.

```txt
Subject: MEETUP_GROUP is not subject to the meetup.com pricing change
---
Hi all,

You might have seen the meetup.com announcement to start charging attendees $2 to RSVP from end of October:

https://www.meetup.com/lp/paymentchanges?mpId=9038
https://www.meetup.com/lp/payment-test-20191016

MEETUP_GROUP is under the CNCF Pro network (https://meetups.cncf.io) and will **not** be affected by these 
changes for now.

Our goal has always been to provide high quality talks to a great community in a friendly and welcoming
environment. Most importantly, **You will never pay to attend** MEETUP_GROUP, or any other meetup group of
the Cloud Native Nordics community.

If further changes and announcements do happen, we will provide further updates and comments
through this channel.
Please reach out to _ORGANIZER_EMAIL_ if you have any questions.

On behalf of the organizers team,
ORGANIZER_NAME
```
